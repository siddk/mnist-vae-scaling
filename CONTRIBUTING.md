# Contributing to Mjolnir

Boilerplate Contribution Guidelines should go here, as well as any specific information (e.g., locations of important
files on shared resources, build guidelines, notes on style/testing).

TL;DR: Follow the Quickstart in the README and make sure to `pre-commit install`!

---

Bare minimum, should have a TL;DR around installing dependencies (specifically `pre-commit`) and any other Quickstart
instructions (should be in main README.md).
